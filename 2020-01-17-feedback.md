# Nick Barnard - feedback

## UX

- [ ] Responsive design -- be carefull with iphone 6/7/8
- [ ] Items aligned: Ads are not aligned when responsive
- [ ] No errors in the console -- nothing major, just a warning
- [ ] Votes / Posts / Deletions give user indication of loading -- up to you / design?

## Functionality

### Articles

- [ ] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load
- [ ] Can sort articles by date created / comment_count / votes -- Indicate number of votes and number of comments in the card, so it can be prooved that has been sorted.
- [ ] Well done adding the specific path for each topic!! No need though of making it an extension of `/topics` as it's not a router as in backend, you can create your own like `articles/coding` as you are rendering articles of that topic.

### Individual Article / Comments

- [ ] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load

## Error Handling

- [ ] Bad topic slug in url

## Code

- [ ] api.js, avatar-lookup.js, dummy-data.js, utils.js --> are not react components, should be outside the components folder
- [ ] Functional components used where possible --> NavBar.js
- [ ] Functions are DRY (`handleChange` for controlled components / api calls)
- [ ] Use object destructuring where possible
- [ ] No `console.log`s / comments
- [ ] remove unnecessary files (e.g. App.test.js)

## README - write your own and make sure that it:

- [ ] has a link to the deployed version
- [ ] provides general info about your app
- [ ] includes links to your back end repo
- [ ] specifies the minimum version of Node required to run locally (check your Node version, `node --version` and use the major version that you are on)
- [ ] has clear instructions on how to run your project locally (`git clone <repo-url>, cd ...`)

## MAKE SURE ALL TESTS ARE STILL PASSING IN BACK END

## Once everything else is complete, here are some extra challenges:

- [ ] Use `aXe` extension to check for a11y issues
- [ ] Make sure any pure functions are extracted and tested with `Jest`
- [ ] Use Context API for sharing logged in user amongst components

### Additional functionality:

- [ ] navigate over pages of articles (if implemented in back-end)
- [ ] navigate over pages of comments (if implemented in back-end)
- [ ] filter / display articles by specific user
- [ ] post new article
- [ ] delete logged in user's articles
